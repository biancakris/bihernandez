                       Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is a process used for software projects.
                       It is often used to design, develop, and test high quality sofwares. It is mainly
                       used in the industry to ensure production of a high quality system that meets or exceeds
                       customer expectations, attain completion within time and cost estimmates, effectively and 
                       efficiently works in the current and planned infrastructure, and is inexpensive to maintain
                       well it being cost-effetive to enhance.
