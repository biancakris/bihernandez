                   It is developed to overcome the weaknesses of the waterfall model. The basic idea is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative)
                   and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during the development of earlier parts or versions of the system.
                   Often used to shrink-wrap application and large system which built-in small phases or segments.

                       Advantages<br>
                       Produces business value early in the development life cycle.
                       Better use of scarce resources through proper increment definition.
                       Can accommodate some change requests between increments.
                       More focused on customer value than the linear approaches.
                       Problems can be detected earlier.

                    Disadvantages<br>
                    Requires heavy documentation
                    Follows a defined set of processes.
                    Defines increments based on function and feature dependencies.
                    Requires more customer involvement than the linear approaches.
                    Partitioning the functions and features might be problematic.
                    Integration between iteration can be an issue if this is not considered during the development.
