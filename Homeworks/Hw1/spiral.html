                    It combines elements of design andn prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages 
                    of top-down and bottom-up concepts. This method of development combines the features of the prototyping model
                    and the waterfall model.
                    Spiral model is favored for large, expensive, and complicated projects.
